- 👋 Hi, I’m Danny! I have a BA in Applied Math from the University of California, Berkeley and an MS in Biomedical Data Science from the University of Wisconsin, Madison. I'm currently a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, deep learning, distributed systems, systems for ML, NLP, computational biology, and computational drug discovery.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on startup ideas that leverage machine learning, NLP, and/or bioinformatics in unique and novel ways!
